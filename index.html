    <h1>My amazing trip</h1>
    <h3>Neftali</h3>
      <p>Just before the lockdown hit, I went on a trip to the beautiful Dutch carebean island Curacao. I did not went just only for the sun and beautiful beaches, but also my new baby nephew. A very sweet and gorgeous little boy. I enjoyed the time i spent with him and also my family. Now it is time to get back to work and finish my last year of school</p>
